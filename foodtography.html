					<p style="font-family: serif; font-size: 15px;">Nafisah enjoys cafe hopping during her free time. Back in Malaysia, she had a routine of visiting <b>art galleries and minimalist cafe</b> during her weekend with two best friends. She also has a collection of her cafe hunting journey which she shared on her social media. Let's get to know some best cafe in Kuala Lumpur and Bangsar city.</p>

				<h2>Breakfast Thieves, Bangsar</h2>
				<p>This is my go-to place in Malaysia since it has really nice view and big portion of food. We had to share with 3 people for a single plate. The food tastes nice and the price is on average range. It might be quite far from train station but it really worth a visit for a cafe-hopping lover.</p>

				<h2>Niko Neko, Bangsar</h2>
				<p>I am a big fan of Matcha latte, and here they serve different kind of matcha latte. You can custom your drink with different proportion of milk and umami. The concept of restaurant is white and cement which makes it looks really minimalist. Overall nice experience!

				<h2>Merchant Lane, Kuala Lumpur</h2>
				<p>This restaurant serves the best cakes in town! It was near to a train station which make it more accessible to non-city customers. They serve variety of cakes with different menus each day. The overall decoration is minimalist and the food prices are on average range.</p>

				<h2>ChoCha Foodstore, Kuala Lumpur</h2>
				<p>This was my first time eating pesto pasta back in 2017. The restaurant is designed with combination of outdoor and indoor spaces. It has old vibes with natural elements which makes it more aesthetically pleasing. The food is a bit expensive, but the view was overall great.</p>
